            // When attaching moves, any field that is left blank should default to zero 
            // Show existing move data when editing news and update item
            // Clear previous move data when editing news and update item

            // In the settings have an option of how long a data has to be in the database before getting archived. e.g. archive data after 3, 4, 6 months
